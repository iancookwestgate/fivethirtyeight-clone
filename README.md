# FiveThirtyEight Politics - Site Clone

#### An effort to replicate the FiveThirtyEight Politics website as closely as possible, all the way down to its media responsiveness when changed in size to match that of an iPad or mobile phone.

#### By **Ian Cook Westgate**

## Description

A website created with HTML, CSS, and SASS where a user can view how the clone compares with the actual FiveThirtyEight Politics website. The user can change the window from the largest to smallest size in order to see how the site reorganizes its elements to meet the needs of different viewports. The site currently has no other functionality.

### Specs

Spec: The site replicates as closely as possible the front page of FiveThirtyEight Politics, at maximum size, as it existed at the time of the work.
  - Original: ![FiveThirtyEight Politics at maximum size](img/fivethirtyeight-original-max.PNG)
  - Clone: ![Clone at maximum size](img/fivethirtyeight-clone-max.PNG)
  - Original scrolled down: ![FiveThirtyEight Politics at maximum size, scrolled down](img/fivethirtyeight-original-scroll-max.PNG)
  - Clone scrolled down: ![Clone at maximum size, scrolled down](img/fivethirtyeight-clone-scroll-max.PNG)

Spec: When the site viewport is decreased in size to 768 pixels in width, the "Politics Podcast" section disappears and the remainder of the bottom navbar snaps into where it used to be. All other elements remain. The site continues to replicate the front page of FiveThirtyEight Politics as closely as possible.

  - Clone pre-768px width: ![Clone before the change to 768 pixels](img/clone-pre-768.PNG)
  - Original post-768px width: ![FiveThirtyEight Politics after the change to 768 pixels](img/original-post-768.PNG)
  - Clone post-768px width: ![Clone after the change to 768 pixels](img/clone-post-768.PNG)

Spec: When the site viewport is decreased in size to 425 pixels in width, a number of elements change: The ABC Logo is replaced by a previously hidden menu, the padding of the HTML is slightly adjusted, the remainder of the bottom navbar is removed, the central banner section is changed from a row to a column to fit the viewport, the interactives bar that was previously on the right (below "Latest Politics") disappears, and the images on the left (below "Latest Politics") shrink down in size. All other elements remain. The site continues to replicate the front page of FiveThirtyEight Politics as closely as possible.

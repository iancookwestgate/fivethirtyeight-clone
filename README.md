# FiveThirtyEight Politics - Site Clone

#### An effort to replicate the FiveThirtyEight Politics website as closely as possible, all the way down to its media responsiveness when changed in size to match that of an iPad or mobile phone.

#### By **Ian Cook Westgate**

## Description

A website created with HTML, CSS, and SASS where a user can view how the clone compares with the actual FiveThirtyEight Politics website. The user can change the window from the largest to smallest size in order to see how the site reorganizes its elements to meet the needs of different viewports.

### Specs

Spec: The site replicates as closely as possible the front page of FiveThirtyEight Politics, at maximum size, as it existed at the time of the work.
